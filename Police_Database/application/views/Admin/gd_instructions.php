	<h3> Where to Apply? </h3>
	<p>Generally you will have to apply for the GD in the Police Station of the area where
	 the incident or matter of interest took place.</p>

	 <h3>What to include in the Application?</h3>
	 <p>
 	For GD the application has to be addressed TO The Officer in Charge (OC).
 	 The rest of the format is similar to other applications â€“ the address of the Police Station,
 	  Subject (this should include the reason for the GD), then elaborate description of the incident
 	   or reason for the general diary and
 	  in the end provide name, present address, permanent address
 	 and contact number. You can also collect the GD Application 
 	format from Service Delivery Officer at the Police Station.
<br> <br>
	

		Points to be noted, there are no fees to apply for a GD. If you cannot write one then the Service Delivery Officer will
		 assist you in writing it. For this there is no service charge. After completing the application the Officer in Charge will
		  set the GD number and date and enlist in the register.
